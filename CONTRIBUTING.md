## Legal Note (The "CLA")

Signatura is an open-source project maintained by **Plug Puppy LLC** (Travis & Tupac). To keep this project sustainable, defend it legally, and offer commercial options to businesses who can't use AGPL, we need to keep the copyright clean.

**The Agreement:**

By submitting a Pull Request to this repository, you agree to license your contribution under the project's existing license (AGPLv3). Furthermore, **you grant Plug Puppy LLC the right to re-license your contribution** under alternative licenses (including commercial licenses) at its discretion.

**Why we do this:**

1.  **Sustainability:** Revenue from commercial licenses funds the development of the Free Open Source version.
2.  **Flexibility:** It allows us to pivot or partner without getting deadlocked by copyright issues.

If you are cool with that, let's build! If not, we totally understand—please do not submit a PR.
